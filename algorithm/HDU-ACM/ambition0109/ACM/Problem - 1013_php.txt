      Problem Description
      The digital root of a positive integer is found by summing the digits of 
      the integer. If the resulting value is a single digit then that digit is 
      the digital root. If the resulting value contains two or more digits, 
      those digits are summed and the process is repeated. This is continued as 
      long as necessary to obtain a single digit.

      For example, consider the positive integer 24. Adding the 2 and the 4 
      yields a value of 6. Since 6 is a single digit, 6 is the digital root of 
      24. Now consider the positive integer 39. Adding the 3 and the 9 yields 
      12. Since 12 is not a single digit, the process must be repeated. Adding 
      the 1 and the 2 yeilds 3, a single digit and also the digital root of 39.

       

      Input
      The input file will contain a list of positive integers, one per line. The 
      end of the input will be indicated by an integer value of zero.

       

      Output
      For each integer in the input, output its digital root on a separate line 
      of the output.
