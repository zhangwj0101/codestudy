      Problem Description
      The three hands of the clock are rotating every second and meeting each 
      other many times everyday. Finally, they get bored of this and each of 
      them would like to stay away from the other two. A hand is happy if it is 
      at least D degrees from any of the rest. You are to calculate how much 
      time in a day that all the hands are happy.

       

      Input
      The input contains many test cases. Each of them has a single line with a 
      real number D between 0 and 120, inclusively. The input is terminated with 
      a D of -1.

       

      Output
      For each D, print in a single line the percentage of time in a day that 
      all of the hands are happy, accurate up to 3 decimal places.
