      Problem Description
      Have you ever played quoit in a playground? Quoit is a game in which flat 
      rings are pitched at some toys, with all the toys encircled awarded.
      In the field of Cyberground, the position of each toy is fixed, and the 
      ring is carefully designed so it can only encircle one toy at a time. On 
      the other hand, to make the game look more attractive, the ring is 
      designed to have the largest radius. Given a configuration of the field, 
      you are supposed to find the radius of such a ring.

      Assume that all the toys are points on a plane. A point is encircled by 
      the ring if the distance between the point and the center of the ring is 
      strictly less than the radius of the ring. If two toys are placed at the 
      same point, the radius of the ring is considered to be 0.

       

      Input
      The input consists of several test cases. For each case, the first line 
      contains an integer N (2 <= N <= 100,000), the total number of toys in the 
      field. Then N lines follow, each contains a pair of (x, y) which are the 
      coordinates of a toy. The input is terminated by N = 0.

       

      Output
      For each test case, print in one line the radius of the ring required by 
      the Cyberground manager, accurate up to 2 decimal places.
