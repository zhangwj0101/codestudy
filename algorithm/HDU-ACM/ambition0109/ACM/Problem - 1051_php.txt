      Problem Description
      There is a pile of n wooden sticks. The length and weight of each stick 
      are known in advance. The sticks are to be processed by a woodworking 
      machine in one by one fashion. It needs some time, called setup time, for 
      the machine to prepare processing a stick. The setup times are associated 
      with cleaning operations and changing tools and shapes in the machine. The 
      setup times of the woodworking machine are given as follows: 

      (a) The setup time for the first wooden stick is 1 minute. 
      (b) Right after processing a stick of length l and weight w , the machine 
      will need no setup time for a stick of length l' and weight w' if l<=l' 
      and w<=w'. Otherwise, it will need 1 minute for setup. 

      You are to find the minimum setup time to process a given pile of n wooden 
      sticks. For example, if you have five sticks whose pairs of length and 
      weight are (4,9), (5,2), (2,1), (3,5), and (1,4), then the minimum setup 
      time should be 2 minutes since there is a sequence of pairs (1,4), (3,5), 
      (4,9), (2,1), (5,2).

       

      Input
      The input consists of T test cases. The number of test cases (T) is given 
      in the first line of the input file. Each test case consists of two lines: 
      The first line has an integer n , 1<=n<=5000, that represents the number 
      of wooden sticks in the test case, and the second line contains n 2 
      positive integers l1, w1, l2, w2, ..., ln, wn, each of magnitude at most 
      10000 , where li and wi are the length and weight of the i th wooden 
      stick, respectively. The 2n integers are delimited by one or more spaces.

       

      Output
      The output should contain the minimum setup time in minutes, one per line.
