      Problem Description
      Julius Caesar lived in a time of danger and intrigue. The hardest 
      situation Caesar ever faced was keeping himself alive. In order for him to 
      survive, he decided to create one of the first ciphers. This cipher was so 
      incredibly sound, that no one could figure it out without knowing how it 
      worked. 
      You are a sub captain of Caesar's army. It is your job to decipher the 
      messages sent by Caesar and provide to your general. The code is simple. 
      For each letter in a plaintext message, you shift it five places to the 
      right to create the secure message (i.e., if the letter is 'A', the cipher 
      text would be 'F'). Since you are creating plain text out of Caesar's 
      messages, you will do the opposite: 

      Cipher text
      A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

      Plain text
      V W X Y Z A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U 

      Only letters are shifted in this cipher. Any non-alphabetical character 
      should remain the same, and all alphabetical characters will be upper 
case.

       

      Input
      Input to this problem will consist of a (non-empty) series of up to 100 
      data sets. Each data set will be formatted according to the following 
      description, and there will be no blank lines separating data sets. All 
      characters will be uppercase. 

      A single data set has 3 components: 

      Start line - A single line, "START" 

      Cipher message - A single line containing from one to two hundred 
      characters, inclusive, comprising a single message from Caesar 

      End line - A single line, "END" 

      Following the final data set will be a single line, "ENDOFINPUT".

       

      Output
      For each data set, there will be exactly one line of output. This is the 
      original message by Caesar.

      Sample Output

I WOULD RATHER BE FIRST IN A LITTLE IBERIAN VILLAGE THAN SECOND IN ROME
DANGER KNOWS FULL WELL THAT CAESAR IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN HE
