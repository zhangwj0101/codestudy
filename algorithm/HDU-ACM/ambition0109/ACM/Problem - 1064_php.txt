      Problem Description
      Larry graduated this year and finally has a job. He’s making a lot of 
      money, but somehow never seems to have enough. Larry has decided that he 
      needs to grab hold of his financial portfolio and solve his financing 
      problems. The first step is to figure out what’s been going on with his 
      money. Larry has his bank account statements and wants to see how much 
      money he has. Help Larry by writing a program to take his closing balance 
      from each of the past twelve months and calculate his average account 
      balance.

       

      Input
      The input will be twelve lines. Each line will contain the closing balance 
      of his bank account for a particular month. Each number will be positive 
      and displayed to the penny. No dollar sign will be included.

       

      Output
      The output will be a single number, the average (mean) of the closing 
      balances for the twelve months. It will be rounded to the nearest penny, 
      preceded immediately by a dollar sign, and followed by the end-of-line. 
      There will be no other spaces or characters in the output.
