      Problem Description
      Consider a group of N students and P courses. Each student visits zero, 
      one or more than one courses. Your task is to determine whether it is 
      possible to form a committee of exactly P students that satisfies 
      simultaneously the conditions:

      . every student in the committee represents a different course (a student 
      can represent a course if he/she visits that course)

      . each course has a representative in the committee

      Your program should read sets of data from a text file. The first line of 
      the input file contains the number of the data sets. Each data set is 
      presented in the following format:

      P N
      Count1 Student1 1 Student1 2 ... Student1 Count1
      Count2 Student2 1 Student2 2 ... Student2 Count2
      ...... 
      CountP StudentP 1 StudentP 2 ... StudentP CountP

      The first line in each data set contains two positive integers separated 
      by one blank: P (1 <= P <= 100) - the number of courses and N (1 <= N <= 
      300) - the number of students. The next P lines describe in sequence of 
      the courses . from course 1 to course P, each line describing a course. 
      The description of course i is a line that starts with an integer Count i 
      (0 <= Count i <= N) representing the number of students visiting course i. 
      Next, after a blank, you'll find the Count i students, visiting the 
      course, each two consecutive separated by one blank. Students are numbered 
      with the positive integers from 1 to N.

      There are no blank lines between consecutive sets of data. Input data are 
      correct.

      The result of the program is on the standard output. For each input data 
      set the program prints on a single line "YES" if it is possible to form a 
      committee and "NO" otherwise. There should not be any leading blanks at 
      the start of the line.
