      Problem Description
      Password security is a tricky thing. Users prefer simple passwords that 
      are easy to remember (like buddy), but such passwords are often insecure. 
      Some sites use random computer-generated passwords (like xvtpzyo), but 
      users have a hard time remembering them and sometimes leave them written 
      on notes stuck to their computer. One potential solution is to generate 
      "pronounceable" passwords that are relatively secure but still easy to 
      remember.

      FnordCom is developing such a password generator. You work in the quality 
      control department, and it's your job to test the generator and make sure 
      that the passwords are acceptable. To be acceptable, a password must 
      satisfy these three rules:

      It must contain at least one vowel.

      It cannot contain three consecutive vowels or three consecutive 
consonants.

      It cannot contain two consecutive occurrences of the same letter, except 
      for 'ee' or 'oo'.

      (For the purposes of this problem, the vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 
      'u'; all other letters are consonants.) Note that these rules are not 
      perfect; there are many common/pronounceable words that are not 
acceptable.

       

      Input
      The input consists of one or more potential passwords, one per line, 
      followed by a line containing only the word 'end' that signals the end of 
      the file. Each password is at least one and at most twenty letters long 
      and consists only of lowercase letters.

       

      Output
      For each password, output whether or not it is acceptable, using the 
      precise format shown in the example.

       

      Sample Input
a
tv
ptoui
bontres
zoggax
wiinq
eep
houctuh
end 

      Sample Output
<a> is acceptable.
<tv> is not acceptable.
<ptoui> is not acceptable.
<bontres> is not acceptable.
<zoggax> is not acceptable.
<wiinq> is not acceptable.
<eep> is acceptable.
<houctuh> is acceptable.
