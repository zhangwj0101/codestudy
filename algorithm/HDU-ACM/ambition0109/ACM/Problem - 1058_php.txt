      Problem Description
      A number whose only prime factors are 2,3,5 or 7 is called a humble 
      number. The sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 
      20, 21, 24, 25, 27, ... shows the first 20 humble numbers. 

      Write a program to find and print the nth element in this sequence

       

      Input
      The input consists of one or more test cases. Each test case consists of 
      one integer n with 1 <= n <= 5842. Input is terminated by a value of zero 
      (0) for n.

       

      Output
      For each test case, print one line saying "The nth humble number is 
      number.". Depending on the value of n, the correct suffix "st", "nd", 
      "rd", or "th" for the ordinal number nth has to be used like it is shown 
      in the sample output.
