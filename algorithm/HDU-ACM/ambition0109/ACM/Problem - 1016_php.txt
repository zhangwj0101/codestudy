      Problem Description
      A ring is compose of n circles as shown in diagram. Put natural number 1, 
      2, ..., n into each circle separately, and the sum of numbers in two 
      adjacent circles should be a prime.

      Note: the number of first circle should always be 1.



       

      Input
      n (0 < n < 20).

       

      Output
      The output format is shown as sample below. Each row represents a series 
      of circle numbers in the ring beginning from 1 clockwisely and 
      anticlockwisely. The order of numbers must satisfy the above requirements. 
      Print solutions in lexicographical order.

      You are to write a program that completes above process.

      Print a blank line after each case.
