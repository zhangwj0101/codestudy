      Problem Description
      A group of researchers are designing an experiment to test the IQ of a 
      monkey. They will hang a banana at the roof of a building, and at the mean 
      time, provide the monkey with some blocks. If the monkey is clever enough, 
      it shall be able to reach the banana by placing one block on the top 
      another to build a tower and climb up to get its favorite food.

      The researchers have n types of blocks, and an unlimited supply of blocks 
      of each type. Each type-i block was a rectangular solid with linear 
      dimensions (xi, yi, zi). A block could be reoriented so that any two of 
      its three dimensions determined the dimensions of the base and the other 
      dimension was the height. 

      They want to make sure that the tallest tower possible by stacking blocks 
      can reach the roof. The problem is that, in building a tower, one block 
      could only be placed on top of another block as long as the two base 
      dimensions of the upper block were both strictly smaller than the 
      corresponding base dimensions of the lower block because there has to be 
      some space for the monkey to step on. This meant, for example, that blocks 
      oriented to have equal-sized bases couldn't be stacked. 

      Your job is to write a program that determines the height of the tallest 
      tower the monkey can build with a given set of blocks.

       

      Input
      The input file will contain one or more test cases. The first line of each 
      test case contains an integer n,
      representing the number of different blocks in the following data set. The 
      maximum value for n is 30.
      Each of the next n lines contains three integers representing the values 
      xi, yi and zi.
      Input is terminated by a value of zero (0) for n.

       

      Output
      For each test case, print one line containing the case number (they are 
      numbered sequentially starting from 1) and the height of the tallest 
      possible tower in the format "Case case: maximum height = height".
