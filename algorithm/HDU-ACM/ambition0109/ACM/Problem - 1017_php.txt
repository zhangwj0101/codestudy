      Problem Description
      Given two integers n and m, count the number of pairs of integers (a,b) 
      such that 0 < a < b < n and (a^2+b^2 +m)/(ab) is an integer.

      This problem contains multiple test cases!

      The first line of a multiple input is an integer N, then a blank line 
      followed by N input blocks. Each input block is in the format indicated in 
      the problem description. There is a blank line between input blocks.

      The output format consists of N output blocks. There is a blank line 
      between output blocks.

       

      Input
      You will be given a number of cases in the input. Each case is specified 
      by a line containing the integers n and m. The end of input is indicated 
      by a case in which n = m = 0. You may assume that 0 < n <= 100.

       

      Output
      For each case, print the case number as well as the number of pairs (a,b) 
      satisfying the given property. Print the output for each case on one line 
      in the format as shown below.
