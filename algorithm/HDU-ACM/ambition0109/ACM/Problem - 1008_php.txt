      Problem Description
      The highest building in our city has only one elevator. A request list is 
      made up with N positive numbers. The numbers denote at which floors the 
      elevator will stop, in specified order. It costs 6 seconds to move the 
      elevator up one floor, and 4 seconds to move down one floor. The elevator 
      will stay for 5 seconds at each stop.

      For a given request list, you are to compute the total time spent to 
      fulfill the requests on the list. The elevator is on the 0th floor at the 
      beginning and does not have to return to the ground floor when the 
      requests are fulfilled.

       

      Input
      There are multiple test cases. Each case contains a positive integer N, 
      followed by N positive numbers. All the numbers in the input are less than 
      100. A test case with N = 0 denotes the end of input. This test case is 
      not to be processed.

       

      Output
      Print the total time on a single line for each test case.
