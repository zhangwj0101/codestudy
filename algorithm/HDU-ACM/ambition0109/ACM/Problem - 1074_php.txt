      Problem Description
      Ignatius has just come back school from the 30th ACM/ICPC. Now he has a 
      lot of homework to do. Every teacher gives him a deadline of handing in 
      the homework. If Ignatius hands in the homework after the deadline, the 
      teacher will reduce his score of the final test, 1 day for 1 point. And as 
      you know, doing homework always takes a long time. So Ignatius wants you 
      to help him to arrange the order of doing homework to minimize the reduced 
      score.
       

      Input
      The input contains several test cases. The first line of the input is a 
      single integer T which is the number of test cases. T test cases follow.
      Each test case start with a positive integer N(1<=N<=15) which indicate 
      the number of homework. Then N lines follow. Each line contains a string 
      S(the subject's name, each string will at most has 100 characters) and two 
      integers D(the deadline of the subject), C(how many days will it take 
      Ignatius to finish this subject's homework). 

      Note: All the subject names are given in the alphabet increasing order. So 
      you may process the problem much easier.

       

      Output
      For each test case, you should output the smallest total reduced score, 
      then give out the order of the subjects, one subject in a line. If there 
      are more than one orders, you should output the alphabet smallest one.

Hint
In the second test case, both Computer->English->Math and Computer->Math->English leads to reduce 3 points, but the 
word "English" appears earlier than the word "Math", so we choose the first order. That is so-called alphabet order.
