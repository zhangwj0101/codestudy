      Problem Description
      FatMouse has stored some cheese in a city. The city can be considered as a 
      square grid of dimension n: each grid location is labelled (p,q) where 0 
      <= p < n and 0 <= q < n. At each grid location Fatmouse has hid between 0 
      and 100 blocks of cheese in a hole. Now he's going to enjoy his favorite 
      food.

      FatMouse begins by standing at location (0,0). He eats up the cheese where 
      he stands and then runs either horizontally or vertically to another 
      location. The problem is that there is a super Cat named Top Killer 
      sitting near his hole, so each time he can run at most k locations to get 
      into the hole before being caught by Top Killer. What is worse -- after 
      eating up the cheese at one location, FatMouse gets fatter. So in order to 
      gain enough energy for his next run, he has to run to a location which 
      have more blocks of cheese than those that were at the current hole.

      Given n, k, and the number of blocks of cheese at each grid location, 
      compute the maximum amount of cheese FatMouse can eat before being unable 
      to move. 

       

      Input
      There are several test cases. Each test case consists of 

      a line containing two integers between 1 and 100: n and k 
      n lines, each with n numbers: the first line contains the number of blocks 
      of cheese at locations (0,0) (0,1) ... (0,n-1); the next line contains the 
      number of blocks of cheese at locations (1,0), (1,1), ... (1,n-1), and so 
      on. 
      The input ends with a pair of -1's. 

       

      Output
      For each test case output in a line the single integer giving the number 
      of blocks of cheese collected.
