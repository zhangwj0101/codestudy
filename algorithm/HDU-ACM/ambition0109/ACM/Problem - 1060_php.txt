      Problem Description
      Given a positive integer N, you should output the leftmost digit of N^N.

       

      Input
      The input contains several test cases. The first line of the input is a 
      single integer T which is the number of test cases. T test cases follow.
      Each test case contains a single positive integer N(1<=N<=1,000,000,000).

       

      Output
      For each test case, you should output the leftmost digit of N^N.

       

      Sample Input
2
3
4 

      Sample Output
2
2

Hint
In the first case, 3 * 3 * 3 = 27, so the leftmost digit is 2.
In the second case, 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 = 256, so the leftmost digit is 2.
