      Problem Description
      Soon after he decided to design a T-shirt for our Algorithm Board on 
      Free-City BBS, XKA found that he was trapped by all kinds of suggestions 
      from everyone on the board. It is indeed a mission-impossible to have 
      everybody perfectly satisfied. So he took a poll to collect people's 
      opinions. Here are what he obtained: N people voted for M design elements 
      (such as the ACM-ICPC logo, big names in computer science, well-known 
      graphs, etc.). Everyone assigned each element a number of satisfaction. 
      However, XKA can only put K (<=M) elements into his design. He needs you 
      to pick for him the K elements such that the total number of satisfaction 
      is maximized.

       

      Input
      The input consists of multiple test cases. For each case, the first line 
      contains three positive integers N, M and K where N is the number of 
      people, M is the number of design elements, and K is the number of 
      elements XKA will put into his design. Then N lines follow, each contains 
      M numbers. The j-th number in the i-th line represents the i-th person's 
      satisfaction on the j-th element.

       

      Output
      For each test case, print in one line the indices of the K elements you 
      would suggest XKA to take into consideration so that the total number of 
      satisfaction is maximized. If there are more than one solutions, you must 
      output the one with minimal indices. The indices start from 1 and must be 
      printed in non-increasing order. There must be exactly one space between 
      two adjacent indices, and no extra space at the end of the line.
