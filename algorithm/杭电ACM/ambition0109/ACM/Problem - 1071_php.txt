      Problem Description
      Ignatius bought a land last week, but he didn't know the area of the land 
      because the land is enclosed by a parabola and a straight line. The 
      picture below shows the area. Now given all the intersectant points shows 
      in the picture, can you tell Ignatius the area of the land?

      Note: The point P1 in the picture is the vertex of the parabola.





       

      Input
      The input contains several test cases. The first line of the input is a 
      single integer T which is the number of test cases. T test cases follow.
      Each test case contains three intersectant points which shows in the 
      picture, they are given in the order of P1, P2, P3. Each point is 
      described by two floating-point numbers X and Y(0.0<=X,Y<=1000.0).

       

      Output
      For each test case, you should output the area of the land, the result 
      should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

       

      Sample Input
2
5.000000 5.000000
0.000000 0.000000
10.000000 0.000000
10.000000 10.000000
1.000000 1.000000
14.000000 8.222222 

      Sample Output
33.33
40.69

Hint
For float may be not accurate enough, please use double instead of float.
