      Problem Description
      Given a string containing only 'A' - 'Z', we could encode it using the 
      following method: 

      1. Each sub-string containing k same characters should be encoded to "kX" 
      where "X" is the only character in this sub-string.

      2. If the length of the sub-string is 1, '1' should be ignored.

       

      Input
      The first line contains an integer N (1 <= N <= 100) which indicates the 
      number of test cases. The next N lines contain N strings. Each string 
      consists of only 'A' - 'Z' and the length is less than 10000.

       

      Output
      For each test case, output the encoded string in a line.
