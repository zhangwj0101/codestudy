      Problem Description
      As the new term comes, the Ignatius Train Station is very busy nowadays. A 
      lot of student want to get back to school by train(because the trains in 
      the Ignatius Train Station is the fastest all over the world ^v^). But 
      here comes a problem, there is only one railway where all the trains stop. 
      So all the trains come in from one side and get out from the other side. 
      For this problem, if train A gets into the railway first, and then train B 
      gets into the railway before train A leaves, train A can't leave until 
      train B leaves. The pictures below figure out the problem. Now the problem 
      for you is, there are at most 9 trains in the station, all the trains has 
      an ID(numbered from 1 to n), the trains get into the railway in an order 
      O1, your task is to determine whether the trains can get out in an order 
      O2.

       

      Input
      The input contains several test cases. Each test case consists of an 
      integer, the number of trains, and two strings, the order of the trains 
      come in:O1, and the order of the trains leave:O2. The input is terminated 
      by the end of file. More details in the Sample Input.

       

      Output
      The output contains a string "No." if you can't exchange O2 to O1, or you 
      should output a line contains "Yes.", and then output your way in 
      exchanging the order(you should output "in" for a train getting into the 
      railway, and "out" for a train getting out of the railway). Print a line 
      contains "FINISH" after each test case. More details in the Sample Output.

       

      Sample Input
3 123 321
3 123 312 

      Sample Output
Yes.
in

in
out

out
FINISH
No.
FINISH

HintHint 
For the first Sample Input, we let train 1 get in, then train 2 and train 3.
So now train 3 is at the top of the railway, so train 3 can leave first, then train 2 and train 1.
In the second Sample input, we should let train 3 leave first, so we have to let train 1 get in, then train 2 and train 3.
Now we can let train 3 leave.
But after that we can't let train 1 leave before train 2, because train 2 is at the top of the railway at the moment.
So we output "No.".
