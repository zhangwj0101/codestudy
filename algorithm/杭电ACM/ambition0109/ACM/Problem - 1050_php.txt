      Problem Description
      The famous ACM (Advanced Computer Maker) Company has rented a floor of a 
      building whose shape is in the following figure. 





      The floor has 200 rooms each on the north side and south side along the 
      corridor. Recently the Company made a plan to reform its system. The 
      reform includes moving a lot of tables between rooms. Because the corridor 
      is narrow and all the tables are big, only one table can pass through the 
      corridor. Some plan is needed to make the moving efficient. The manager 
      figured out the following plan: Moving a table from a room to another room 
      can be done within 10 minutes. When moving a table from room i to room j, 
      the part of the corridor between the front of room i and the front of room 
      j is used. So, during each 10 minutes, several moving between two rooms 
      not sharing the same part of the corridor will be done simultaneously. To 
      make it clear the manager illustrated the possible cases and impossible 
      cases of simultaneous moving. 





      For each room, at most one table will be either moved in or moved out. 
      Now, the manager seeks out a method to minimize the time to move all the 
      tables. Your job is to write a program to solve the manager’s problem.

       

      Input
      The input consists of T test cases. The number of test cases ) (T is given 
      in the first line of the input. Each test case begins with a line 
      containing an integer N , 1<=N<=200 , that represents the number of tables 
      to move. Each of the following N lines contains two positive integers s 
      and t, representing that a table is to move from room number s to room 
      number t (each room number appears at most once in the N lines). From the 
      N+3-rd line, the remaining test cases are listed in the same manner as 
      above.

       

      Output
      The output should contain the minimum time in minutes to complete the 
      moving, one per line.
