      Problem Description
      The doggie found a bone in an ancient maze, which fascinated him a lot. 
      However, when he picked it up, the maze began to shake, and the doggie 
      could feel the ground sinking. He realized that the bone was a trap, and 
      he tried desperately to get out of this maze.

      The maze was a rectangle with sizes N by M. There was a door in the maze. 
      At the beginning, the door was closed and it would open at the T-th second 
      for a short period of time (less than 1 second). Therefore the doggie had 
      to arrive at the door on exactly the T-th second. In every second, he 
      could move one block to one of the upper, lower, left and right 
      neighboring blocks. Once he entered a block, the ground of this block 
      would start to sink and disappear in the next second. He could not stay at 
      one block for more than one second, nor could he move into a visited 
      block. Can the poor doggie survive? Please help him.

       

      Input
      The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of each test 
      case contains three integers N, M, and T (1 < N, M < 7; 0 < T < 50), which 
      denote the sizes of the maze and the time at which the door will open, 
      respectively. The next N lines give the maze layout, with each line 
      containing M characters. A character is one of the following:

      'X': a block of wall, which the doggie cannot enter; 
      'S': the start point of the doggie; 
      'D': the Door; or
      '.': an empty block.

      The input is terminated with three 0's. This test case is not to be 
      processed.

       

      Output
      For each test case, print in one line "YES" if the doggie can survive, or 
      "NO" otherwise.
