      Problem Description
      The Princess has been abducted by the BEelzebub feng5166, our hero 
      Ignatius has to rescue our pretty Princess. Now he gets into feng5166's 
      castle. The castle is a large labyrinth. To make the problem simply, we 
      assume the labyrinth is a N*M two-dimensional array which left-top corner 
      is (0,0) and right-bottom corner is (N-1,M-1). Ignatius enters at (0,0), 
      and the door to feng5166's room is at (N-1,M-1), that is our target. There 
      are some monsters in the castle, if Ignatius meet them, he has to kill 
      them. Here is some rules:

      1.Ignatius can only move in four directions(up, down, left, right), one 
      step per second. A step is defined as follow: if current position is 
      (x,y), after a step, Ignatius can only stand on (x-1,y), (x+1,y), (x,y-1) 
      or (x,y+1).
      2.The array is marked with some characters and numbers. We define them 
      like this:
      . : The place where Ignatius can walk on.
      X : The place is a trap, Ignatius should not walk on it.
      n : Here is a monster with n HP(1<=n<=9), if Ignatius walk on it, it takes 
      him n seconds to kill the monster.

      Your task is to give out the path which costs minimum seconds for Ignatius 
      to reach target position. You may assume that the start position and the 
      target position will never be a trap, and there will never be a monster at 
      the start position.

       

      Input
      The input contains several test cases. Each test case starts with a line 
      contains two numbers N and M(2<=N<=100,2<=M<=100) which indicate the size 
      of the labyrinth. Then a N*M two-dimensional array follows, which describe 
      the whole labyrinth. The input is terminated by the end of file. More 
      details in the Sample Input.

       

      Output
      For each test case, you should output "God please help our poor hero." if 
      Ignatius can't reach the target position, or you should output "It takes n 
      seconds to reach the target position, let me show you the way."(n is the 
      minimum seconds), and tell our hero the whole path. Output a line contains 
      "FINISH" after each test case. If there are more than one path, any one is 
      OK in this problem. More details in the Sample Output.
