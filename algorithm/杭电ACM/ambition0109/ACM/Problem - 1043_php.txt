      Problem Description
      The 15-puzzle has been around for over 100 years; even if you don't know 
      it by that name, you've seen it. It is constructed with 15 sliding tiles, 
      each with a number from 1 to 15 on it, and all packed into a 4 by 4 frame 
      with one tile missing. Let's call the missing tile 'x'; the object of the 
      puzzle is to arrange the tiles so that they are ordered as: 

 1  2  3  4 5  6  7  8 9 10 11 1213 14 15  x
      where the only legal operation is to exchange 'x' with one of the tiles 
      with which it shares an edge. As an example, the following sequence of 
      moves solves a slightly scrambled puzzle: 

 1  2  3  4     1  2  3  4     1  2  3  4     1  2  3  4 5  6  7  8     5  6  7  8     5  6  7  8     5  6  7  8 9  x 10 12     9 10  x 12     9 10 11 12     9 10 11 1213 14 11 15    13 14 11 15    13 14  x 15    13 14 15  x            r->            d->            r->
      The letters in the previous row indicate which neighbor of the 'x' tile is 
      swapped with the 'x' tile at each step; legal values are 'r','l','u' and 
      'd', for right, left, up, and down, respectively. 

      Not all puzzles can be solved; in 1870, a man named Sam Loyd was famous 
      for distributing an unsolvable version of the puzzle, and 
      frustrating many people. In fact, all you have to do to make a regular 
      puzzle into an unsolvable one is to swap two tiles (not counting the 
      missing 'x' tile, of course). 

      In this problem, you will write a program for solving the less well-known 
      8-puzzle, composed of tiles on a three by three 
      arrangement.

       

      Input
      You will receive, several descriptions of configuration of the 8 puzzle. 
      One description is just a list of the tiles in their initial positions, 
      with the rows listed from top to bottom, and the tiles listed from left to 
      right within a row, where the tiles are represented by numbers 1 to 8, 
      plus 'x'. For example, this puzzle 

      1 2 3 
      x 4 6 
      7 5 8 

      is described by this list: 

      1 2 3 x 4 6 7 5 8

       

      Output
      You will print to standard output either the word ``unsolvable'', if the 
      puzzle has no solution, or a string consisting entirely of the letters 
      'r', 'l', 'u' and 'd' that describes a series of moves that produce a 
      solution. The string should include no spaces and start at the beginning 
      of the line. Do not print a blank line between cases.
