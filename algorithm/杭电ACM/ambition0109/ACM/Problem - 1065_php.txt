      Problem Description


      Fred Mapper is considering purchasing some land in Louisiana to build his 
      house on. In the process of investigating the land, he learned that the 
      state of Louisiana is actually shrinking by 50 square miles each year, due 
      to erosion caused by the Mississippi River. Since Fred is hoping to live 
      in this house the rest of his life, he needs to know if his land is going 
      to be lost to erosion. 

      After doing more research, Fred has learned that the land that is being 
      lost forms a semicircle. This semicircle is part of a circle centered at 
      (0,0), with the line that bisects the circle being the X axis. Locations 
      below the X axis are in the water. The semicircle has an area of 0 at the 
      beginning of year 1. (Semicircle illustrated in the Figure.) 



       

      Input
      The first line of input will be a positive integer indicating how many 
      data sets will be included (N). 

      Each of the next N lines will contain the X and Y Cartesian coordinates of 
      the land Fred is considering. These will be floating point numbers 
      measured in miles. The Y coordinate will be non-negative. (0,0) will not 
      be given.

       

      Output
      For each data set, a single line of output should appear. This line should 
      take the form of: 

      “Property N: This property will begin eroding in year Z.” 

      Where N is the data set (counting from 1), and Z is the first year (start 
      from 1) this property will be within the semicircle AT THE END OF YEAR Z. 
      Z must be an integer. 

      After the last data set, this should print out “END OF OUTPUT.” 

      Notes: 

      1. No property will appear exactly on the semicircle boundary: it will 
      either be inside or outside. 

      2. This problem will be judged automatically. Your answer must match 
      exactly, including the capitalization, punctuation, and white-space. This 
      includes the periods at the ends of the lines. 

      3. All locations are given in miles.

       

      Sample Input
2 
1.0 1.0 
25.0 0.0 

      Sample Output
Property 1: This property will begin eroding in year 1. 
Property 2: This property will begin eroding in year 20. 
END OF OUTPUT.
