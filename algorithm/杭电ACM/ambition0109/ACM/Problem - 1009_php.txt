      Problem Description
      FatMouse prepared M pounds of cat food, ready to trade with the cats 
      guarding the warehouse containing his favorite food, JavaBean.
      The warehouse has N rooms. The i-th room contains J[i] pounds of JavaBeans 
      and requires F[i] pounds of cat food. FatMouse does not have to trade for 
      all the JavaBeans in the room, instead, he may get J[i]* a% pounds of 
      JavaBeans if he pays F[i]* a% pounds of cat food. Here a is a real number. 
      Now he is assigning this homework to you: tell him the maximum amount of 
      JavaBeans he can obtain.

       

      Input
      The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case begins with a 
      line containing two non-negative integers M and N. Then N lines follow, 
      each contains two non-negative integers J[i] and F[i] respectively. The 
      last test case is followed by two -1's. All integers are not greater than 
      1000.

       

      Output
      For each test case, print in a single line a real number accurate up to 3 
      decimal places, which is the maximum amount of JavaBeans that FatMouse can 
      obtain.
