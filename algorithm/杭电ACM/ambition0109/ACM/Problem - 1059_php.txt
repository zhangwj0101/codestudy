      Problem Description
      Marsha and Bill own a collection of marbles. They want to split the 
      collection among themselves so that both receive an equal share of the 
      marbles. This would be easy if all the marbles had the same value, because 
      then they could just split the collection in half. But unfortunately, some 
      of the marbles are larger, or more beautiful than others. So, Marsha and 
      Bill start by assigning a value, a natural number between one and six, to 
      each marble. Now they want to divide the marbles so that each of them gets 
      the same total value. 
      Unfortunately, they realize that it might be impossible to divide the 
      marbles in this way (even if the total value of all marbles is even). For 
      example, if there are one marble of value 1, one of value 3 and two of 
      value 4, then they cannot be split into sets of equal value. So, they ask 
      you to write a program that checks whether there is a fair partition of 
      the marbles.

       

      Input
      Each line in the input describes one collection of marbles to be divided. 
      The lines consist of six non-negative integers n1, n2, ..., n6, where ni 
      is the number of marbles of value i. So, the example from above would be 
      described by the input-line ``1 0 1 2 0 0''. The maximum total number of 
      marbles will be 20000. 

      The last line of the input file will be ``0 0 0 0 0 0''; do not process 
      this line.

       

      Output
      For each colletcion, output ``Collection #k:'', where k is the number of 
      the test case, and then either ``Can be divided.'' or ``Can't be 
      divided.''. 

      Output a blank line after each test case.

       

      Sample Input
1 0 1 2 0 0
1 0 0 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 

      Sample Output
Collection #1:
Can't be divided.

Collection #2:
Can be divided.
