      Problem Description
      A number of students sit in a circle facing their teacher in the center. 
      Each student initially has an even number of pieces of candy. When the 
      teacher blows a whistle, each student simultaneously gives half of his or 
      her candy to the neighbor on the right. Any student, who ends up with an 
      odd number of pieces of candy, is given another piece by the teacher. The 
      game ends when all students have the same number of pieces of candy. 
      Write a program which determines the number of times the teacher blows the 
      whistle and the final number of pieces of candy for each student from the 
      amount of candy each child starts with.

       

      Input
      The input may describe more than one game. For each game, the input begins 
      with the number N of students, followed by N (even) candy counts for the 
      children counter-clockwise around the circle. The input ends with a 
      student count of 0. Each input number is on a line by itself.

       

      Output
      For each game, output the number of rounds of the game followed by the 
      amount of candy each child ends up with, both on one line.

Hint
The game ends in a finite number of steps because:
1. The maximum candy count can never increase.
2. The minimum candy count can never decrease.
3. No one with more than the minimum amount will ever decrease to the minimum.
4. If the maximum and minimum candy count are not the same, at least one student with the minimum amount must have their count increase.
