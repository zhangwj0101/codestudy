      Problem Description
      How far can you make a stack of cards overhang a table? If you have one 
      card, you can create a maximum overhang of half a card length. (We're 
      assuming that the cards must be perpendicular to the table.) With two 
      cards you can make the top card overhang the bottom one by half a card 
      length, and the bottom one overhang the table by a third of a card length, 
      for a total maximum overhang of 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6 card lengths. In general 
      you can make n cards overhang by 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... + 1/(n + 1) card 
      lengths, where the top card overhangs the second by 1/2, the second 
      overhangs tha third by 1/3, the third overhangs the fourth by 1/4, etc., 
      and the bottom card overhangs the table by 1/(n + 1). This is illustrated 
      in the figure below.

       

      The input consists of one or more test cases, followed by a line 
      containing the number 0.00 that signals the end of the input. Each test 
      case is a single line containing a positive floating-point number c whose 
      value is at least 0.01 and at most 5.20; c will contain exactly three 
      digits.

      For each test case, output the minimum number of cards necessary to 
      achieve an overhang of at least c card lengths. Use the exact output 
      format shown in the examples.
