      Problem Description
      Ignatius was born in a leap year, so he want to know when he could hold 
      his birthday party. Can you tell him?

      Given a positive integers Y which indicate the start year, and a positive 
      integer N, your task is to tell the Nth leap year from year Y.

      Note: if year Y is a leap year, then the 1st leap year is year Y.

       

      Input
      The input contains several test cases. The first line of the input is a 
      single integer T which is the number of test cases. T test cases follow.
      Each test case contains two positive integers Y and N(1<=N<=10000).

       

      Output
      For each test case, you should output the Nth leap year from year Y.

       

      Sample Input
3
2005 25
1855 12
2004 10000 

      Sample Output
2108
1904
43236

Hint
We call year Y a leap year only if (Y%4==0 && Y%100!=0) or Y%400==0.
