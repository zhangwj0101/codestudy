      Problem Description
      We all know that Bin-Laden is a notorious terrorist, and he has 
      disappeared for a long time. But recently, it is reported that he hides in 
      Hang Zhou of China! 
      “Oh, God! How terrible! ”





      Don’t be so afraid, guys. Although he hides in a cave of Hang Zhou, he 
      dares not to go out. Laden is so bored recent years that he fling himself 
      into some math problems, and he said that if anyone can solve his problem, 
      he will give himself up! 
      Ha-ha! Obviously, Laden is too proud of his intelligence! But, what is his 
      problem?
      “Given some Chinese Coins (硬币) (three kinds-- 1, 2, 5), and their number 
      is num_1, num_2 and num_5 respectively, please output the minimum value 
      that you cannot pay with given coins.”
      You, super ACMer, should solve the problem easily, and don’t forget to 
      take $25000000 from Bush!

       

      Input
      Input contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains 3 positive 
      integers num_1, num_2 and num_5 (0<=num_i<=1000). A test case containing 0 
      0 0 terminates the input and this test case is not to be processed.

       

      Output
      Output the minimum positive value that one cannot pay with given coins, 
      one line for one case.
