      Problem Description
      The least common multiple (LCM) of a set of positive integers is the 
      smallest positive integer which is divisible by all the numbers in the 
      set. For example, the LCM of 5, 7 and 15 is 105.


       

      Input
      Input will consist of multiple problem instances. The first line of the 
      input will contain a single integer indicating the number of problem 
      instances. Each instance will consist of a single line of the form m n1 n2 
      n3 ... nm where m is the number of integers in the set and n1 ... nm are 
      the integers. All integers will be positive and lie within the range of a 
      32-bit integer.

       

      Output
      For each problem instance, output a single line containing the 
      corresponding LCM. All results will lie in the range of a 32-bit integer.
