      Problem Description
      Ignatius likes to write words in reverse way. Given a single line of text 
      which is written by Ignatius, you should reverse all the words and then 
      output them.

       

      Input
      The input contains several test cases. The first line of the input is a 
      single integer T which is the number of test cases. T test cases follow.
      Each test case contains a single line with several words. There will be at 
      most 1000 characters in a line.

       

      Output
      For each test case, you should output the text which is processed.

       

      Sample Input
3
olleh !dlrow
m'I morf .udh
I ekil .mca 

      Sample Output
hello world!
I'm from hdu.
I like acm.

Hint
Remember to use getchar() to read '\n' after the interger T, then you may use gets() to read a line and process it.
