      Problem Description
      A simple mathematical formula for e is



      where n is allowed to go to infinity. This can actually yield very 
      accurate approximations of e using relatively small values of n.

       

      Output
      Output the approximations of e generated by the above formula for the 
      values of n from 0 to 9. The beginning of your output should appear 
      similar to that shown below.
