      these applications are using keys for secure transmission of data, 
      encryption, etc. In this problem you are given a number, you have to 
      determine the number of digits in the factorial of the number.

       

      Input
      Input consists of several lines of integer numbers. The first line 
      contains an integer n, which is the number of cases to be tested, followed 
      by n lines, one integer 1 ≤ n ≤ 107 on each line.

       

      Output
      The output contains the number of digits in the factorial of the integers 
      appearing in the input.
