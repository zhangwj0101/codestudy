      Problem Description
      Boudreaux and Thibodeaux are on the road again . . .

      "Boudreaux, we have to get this shipment of mudbugs to Baton Rouge by 
      tonight!"

      "Don't worry, Thibodeaux, I already checked ahead. There are three 
      underpasses and our 18-wheeler will fit through all of them, so just keep 
      that motor running!"

      "We're not going to make it, I say!"

      So, which is it: will there be a very messy accident on Interstate 10, or 
      is Thibodeaux just letting the sound of his own wheels drive him crazy?

       

      Input
      Input to this problem will consist of a single data set. The data set will 
      be formatted according to the following description.

      The data set will consist of a single line containing 3 numbers, separated 
      by single spaces. Each number represents the height of a single underpass 
      in inches. Each number will be between 0 and 300 inclusive.

       

      Output
      There will be exactly one line of output. This line will be:

         NO CRASH

      if the height of the 18-wheeler is less than the height of each of the 
      underpasses, or:

         CRASH X

      otherwise, where X is the height of the first underpass in the data set 
      that the 18-wheeler is unable to go under (which means its height is less 
      than or equal to the height of the 18-wheeler). 
      The height of the 18-wheeler is 168 inches.

       

      Sample Input
180 160 170 

      Sample Output
