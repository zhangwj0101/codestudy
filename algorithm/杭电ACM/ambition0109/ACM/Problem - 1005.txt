      Problem Description
      A number sequence is defined as follows:

      f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(n) = (A * f(n - 1) + B * f(n - 2)) mod 7.

      Given A, B, and n, you are to calculate the value of f(n).

       

      Input
      The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case contains 3 
      integers A, B and n on a single line (1 <= A, B <= 1000, 1 <= n <= 
      100,000,000). Three zeros signal the end of input and this test case is 
      not to be processed.

       

      Output
      For each test case, print the value of f(n) on a single line.
