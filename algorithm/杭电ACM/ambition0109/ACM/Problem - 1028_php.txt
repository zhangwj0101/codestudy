      Problem Description
      "Well, it seems the first problem is too easy. I will let you know how 
      foolish you are later." feng5166 says.

      "The second problem is, given an positive integer N, we define an equation 
      like this:
        N=a[1]+a[2]+a[3]+...+a[m];
        a[i]>0,1<=m<=N;
      My question is how many different equations you can find for a given N.
      For example, assume N is 4, we can find:
        4 = 4;
        4 = 3 + 1;
        4 = 2 + 2;
        4 = 2 + 1 + 1;
        4 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1;
      so the result is 5 when N is 4. Note that "4 = 3 + 1" and "4 = 1 + 3" is 
      the same in this problem. Now, you do it!"

       

      Input
      The input contains several test cases. Each test case contains a positive 
      integer N(1<=N<=120) which is mentioned above. The input is terminated by 
      the end of file.

       

      Output
      For each test case, you have to output a line contains an integer P which 
      indicate the different equations you have found.
