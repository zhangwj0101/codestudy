      Problem Description
      the second year of the university somebody started a study on the romantic 
      relations between the students. The relation “romantically involved” is 
      defined between one girl and one boy. For the study reasons it is 
      necessary to find out the maximum set satisfying the condition: there are 
      no two students in the set who have been “romantically involved”. The 
      result of the program is the number of students in such a set.

      The input contains several data sets in text format. Each data set 
      represents one set of subjects of the study, with the following 
      description:

      the number of students
      the description of each student, in the following format
      student_identifier:(number_of_romantic_relations) student_identifier1 
      student_identifier2 student_identifier3 ...
      or
      student_identifier:(0)

      The student_identifier is an integer number between 0 and n-1, for n 
      subjects.
      For each given data set, the program should write to standard output a 
      line containing the result.
