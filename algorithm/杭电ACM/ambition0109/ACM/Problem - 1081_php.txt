      Problem Description
      Given a two-dimensional array of positive and negative integers, a 
      sub-rectangle is any contiguous sub-array of size 1 x 1 or greater located 
      within the whole array. The sum of a rectangle is the sum of all the 
      elements in that rectangle. In this problem the sub-rectangle with the 
      largest sum is referred to as the maximal sub-rectangle.

      As an example, the maximal sub-rectangle of the array:

      0 -2 -7 0
      9 2 -6 2
      -4 1 -4 1
      -1 8 0 -2

      is in the lower left corner:

      9 2
      -4 1
      -1 8

      and has a sum of 15.

       

      Input
      The input consists of an N x N array of integers. The input begins with a 
      single positive integer N on a line by itself, indicating the size of the 
      square two-dimensional array. This is followed by N 2 integers separated 
      by whitespace (spaces and newlines). These are the N 2 integers of the 
      array, presented in row-major order. That is, all numbers in the first 
      row, left to right, then all numbers in the second row, left to right, 
      etc. N may be as large as 100. The numbers in the array will be in the 
      range [-127,127].

       

      Output
      Output the sum of the maximal sub-rectangle.
