      Problem Description
      A triangle field is numbered with successive integers in the way shown on 
      the picture below. 





      The traveller needs to go from the cell with number M to the cell with 
      number N. The traveller is able to enter the cell through cell edges only, 
      he can not travel from cell to cell through vertices. The number of edges 
      the traveller passes makes the length of the traveller's route. 

      Write the program to determine the length of the shortest route connecting 
      cells with numbers N and M. 

       

      Input
      Input contains two integer numbers M and N in the range from 1 to 
      1000000000 separated with space(s).
       

      Output
      Output should contain the length of the shortest route.
