      Problem Description
      === Op tech briefing, 2002/11/02 06:42 CST === 
      "The item is locked in a Klein safe behind a painting in the second-floor 
      library. Klein safes are extremely rare; most of them, along with Klein 
      and his factory, were destroyed in World War II. Fortunately old Brumbaugh 
      from research knew Klein's secrets and wrote them down before he died. A 
      Klein safe has two distinguishing features: a combination lock that uses 
      letters instead of numbers, and an engraved quotation on the door. A Klein 
      quotation always contains between five and twelve distinct uppercase 
      letters, usually at the beginning of sentences, and mentions one or more 
      numbers. Five of the uppercase letters form the combination that opens the 
      safe. By combining the digits from all the numbers in the appropriate way 
      you get a numeric target. (The details of constructing the target number 
      are classified.) To find the combination you must select five letters v, 
      w, x, y, and z that satisfy the following equation, where each letter is 
      replaced by its ordinal position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26). 
      The combination is then vwxyz. If there is more than one solution then the 
      combination is the one that is lexicographically greatest, i.e., the one 
      that would appear last in a dictionary." 

      v - w^2 + x^3 - y^4 + z^5 = target 

      "For example, given target 1 and letter set ABCDEFGHIJKL, one possible 
      solution is FIECB, since 6 - 9^2 + 5^3 - 3^4 + 2^5 = 1. There are actually 
      several solutions in this case, and the combination turns out to be LKEBA. 
      Klein thought it was safe to encode the combination within the engraving, 
      because it could take months of effort to try all the possibilities even 
      if you knew the secret. But of course computers didn't exist then." 

      === Op tech directive, computer division, 2002/11/02 12:30 CST === 

      "Develop a program to find Klein combinations in preparation for field 
      deployment. Use standard test methodology as per departmental regulations. 
      Input consists of one or more lines containing a positive integer target 
      less than twelve million, a space, then at least five and at most twelve 
      distinct uppercase letters. The last line will contain a target of zero 
      and the letters END; this signals the end of the input. For each line 
      output the Klein combination, break ties with lexicographic order, or 'no 
      solution' if there is no correct combination. Use the exact format shown 
      below."
