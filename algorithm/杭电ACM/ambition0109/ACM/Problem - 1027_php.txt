      Problem Description
      Now our hero finds the door to the BEelzebub feng5166. He opens the door 
      and finds feng5166 is about to kill our pretty Princess. But now the 
      BEelzebub has to beat our hero first. feng5166 says, "I have three 
      question for you, if you can work them out, I will release the Princess, 
      or you will be my dinner, too." Ignatius says confidently, "OK, at last, I 
      will save the Princess."

      "Now I will show you the first problem." feng5166 says, "Given a sequence 
      of number 1 to N, we define that 1,2,3...N-1,N is the smallest sequence 
      among all the sequence which can be composed with number 1 to N(each 
      number can be and should be use only once in this problem). So it's easy 
      to see the second smallest sequence is 1,2,3...N,N-1. Now I will give you 
      two numbers, N and M. You should tell me the Mth smallest sequence which 
      is composed with number 1 to N. It's easy, isn't is? Hahahahaha......"
      Can you help Ignatius to solve this problem?

       

      Input
      The input contains several test cases. Each test case consists of two 
      numbers, N and M(1<=N<=1000, 1<=M<=10000). You may assume that there is 
      always a sequence satisfied the BEelzebub's demand. The input is 
      terminated by the end of file.

       

      Output
      For each test case, you only have to output the sequence satisfied the 
      BEelzebub's demand. When output a sequence, you should print a space 
      between two numbers, but do not output any spaces after the last number.
