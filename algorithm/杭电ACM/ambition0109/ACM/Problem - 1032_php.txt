      Problem Description
      Problems in Computer Science are often classified as belonging to a 
      certain class of problems (e.g., NP, Unsolvable, Recursive). In this 
      problem you will be analyzing a property of an algorithm whose 
      classification is not known for all possible inputs.

      Consider the following algorithm: 


          1.      input n

          2.      print n

          3.      if n = 1 then STOP

          4.           if n is odd then n <- 3n + 1

          5.           else n <- n / 2

          6.      GOTO 2


      Given the input 22, the following sequence of numbers will be printed 22 
      11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1 

      It is conjectured that the algorithm above will terminate (when a 1 is 
      printed) for any integral input value. Despite the simplicity of the 
      algorithm, it is unknown whether this conjecture is true. It has been 
      verified, however, for all integers n such that 0 < n < 1,000,000 (and, in 
      fact, for many more numbers than this.) 

      Given an input n, it is possible to determine the number of numbers 
      printed (including the 1). For a given n this is called the cycle-length 
      of n. In the example above, the cycle length of 22 is 16. 

      For any two numbers i and j you are to determine the maximum cycle length 
      over all numbers between i and j. 

       

      Input
      The input will consist of a series of pairs of integers i and j, one pair 
      of integers per line. All integers will be less than 1,000,000 and greater 
      than 0. 

      You should process all pairs of integers and for each pair determine the 
      maximum cycle length over all integers between and including i and j. 

      You can assume that no opperation overflows a 32-bit integer.

       

      Output
      For each pair of input integers i and j you should output i, j, and the 
      maximum cycle length for integers between and including i and j. These 
      three numbers should be separated by at least one space with all three 
      numbers on one line and with one line of output for each line of input. 
      The integers i and j must appear in the output in the same order in which 
      they appeared in the input and should be followed by the maximum cycle 
      length (on the same line).

100 200
201 210
900 1000 

      Sample Output

100 200 125
201 210 89
900 1000 174
