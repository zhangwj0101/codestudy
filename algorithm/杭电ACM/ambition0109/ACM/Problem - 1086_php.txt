      Problem Description
      Many geometry（几何）problems were designed in the ACM/ICPC. And now, I also 
      prepare a geometry problem for this final exam. According to the 
      experience of many ACMers, geometry problems are always much trouble, but 
      this problem is very easy, after all we are now attending an exam, not a 
      contest :)
      Give you N (1<=N<=100) segments（线段）, please output the number of all 
      intersections（交点）. You should count repeatedly if M (M>2) segments 
      intersect at the same point.

      Note:
      You can assume that two segments would not intersect at more than one 
      point. 

       

      Input
      Input contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains a integer N 
      (1=N<=100) in a line first, and then N lines follow. Each line describes 
      one segment with four float values x1, y1, x2, y2 which are coordinates of 
      the segment’s ending. 
      A test case starting with 0 terminates the input and this test case is not 
      to be processed.

       

      Output
      For each case, print the number of intersections, and one line one case.
