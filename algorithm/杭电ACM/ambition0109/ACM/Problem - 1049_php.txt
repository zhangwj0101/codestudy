      Problem Description
      An inch worm is at the bottom of a well n inches deep. It has enough 
      energy to climb u inches every minute, but then has to rest a minute 
      before climbing again. During the rest, it slips down d inches. The 
      process of climbing and resting then repeats. How long before the worm 
      climbs out of the well? We'll always count a portion of a minute as a 
      whole minute and if the worm just reaches the top of the well at the end 
      of its climbing, we'll assume the worm makes it out.

       

      Input
      There will be multiple problem instances. Each line will contain 3 
      positive integers n, u and d. These give the values mentioned in the 
      paragraph above. Furthermore, you may assume d < u and n < 100. A value of 
      n = 0 indicates end of output.

       

      Output
      Each input instance should generate a single integer on a line, indicating 
      the number of minutes it takes for the worm to climb out of the well.
