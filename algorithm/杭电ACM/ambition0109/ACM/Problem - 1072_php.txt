      Problem Description
      Ignatius had a nightmare last night. He found himself in a labyrinth with 
      a time bomb on him. The labyrinth has an exit, Ignatius should get out of 
      the labyrinth before the bomb explodes. The initial exploding time of the 
      bomb is set to 6 minutes. To prevent the bomb from exploding by shake, 
      Ignatius had to move slowly, that is to move from one area to the nearest 
      area(that is, if Ignatius stands on (x,y) now, he could only on (x+1,y), 
      (x-1,y), (x,y+1), or (x,y-1) in the next minute) takes him 1 minute. Some 
      area in the labyrinth contains a Bomb-Reset-Equipment. They could reset 
      the exploding time to 6 minutes.

      Given the layout of the labyrinth and Ignatius' start position, please 
      tell Ignatius whether he could get out of the labyrinth, if he could, 
      output the minimum time that he has to use to find the exit of the 
      labyrinth, else output -1.

      Here are some rules:
      1. We can assume the labyrinth is a 2 array.
      2. Each minute, Ignatius could only get to one of the nearest area, and he 
      should not walk out of the border, of course he could not walk on a wall, 
      too.
      3. If Ignatius get to the exit when the exploding time turns to 0, he 
      can't get out of the labyrinth.
      4. If Ignatius get to the area which contains Bomb-Rest-Equipment when the 
      exploding time turns to 0, he can't use the equipment to reset the bomb.
      5. A Bomb-Reset-Equipment can be used as many times as you wish, if it is 
      needed, Ignatius can get to any areas in the labyrinth as many times as 
      you wish.
      6. The time to reset the exploding time can be ignore, in other words, if 
      Ignatius get to an area which contain Bomb-Rest-Equipment, and the 
      exploding time is larger than 0, the exploding time would be reset to 6.

       

      Input
      The input contains several test cases. The first line of the input is a 
      single integer T which is the number of test cases. T test cases follow.
      Each test case starts with two integers N and M(1<=N,Mm=8) which indicate 
      the size of the labyrinth. Then N lines follow, each line contains M 
      integers. The array indicates the layout of the labyrinth.
      There are five integers which indicate the different type of area in the 
      labyrinth:
      0: The area is a wall, Ignatius should not walk on it.
      1: The area contains nothing, Ignatius can walk on it.
      2: Ignatius' start position, Ignatius starts his escape from this 
position.
      3: The exit of the labyrinth, Ignatius' target position.
      4: The area contains a Bomb-Reset-Equipment, Ignatius can delay the 
      exploding time by walking to these areas.

       

      Output
      For each test case, if Ignatius can get out of the labyrinth, you should 
      output the minimum time he needs, else you should just output -1.
